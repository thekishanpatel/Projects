# **Cosine KMeans**

In NLP, the cosine-similarity is a measure of how similar word-vectors are to one-another.  
We can use this measure to cluster words and articles of text based on how similar they are to one another.  
Here I have transformed the K-Means algorithm to use the **cosine-similarity** as a measure instead of **distance**.
