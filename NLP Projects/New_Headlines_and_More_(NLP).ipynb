        "Machine Learning models, and more broadly Artificial Intelligence applications, are built using ***data***. Traditionally when we think of the data used for machine learning processes, we think of tabular data and/or image data. But as humans, our natural form of communication isn't through tabular data or image data. Our brains can see images, but we use ***words*** to describe these images--not numbers. These ***words*** make up the natural languages--the method of communication for humans.  As computers are now becoming engrained in our lives, the ability to interact with techonology is becoming ever-so-important. ***Natural Language Processing (NLP)*** is the branch of artificial intelligence that concerns with the interaction between computers and humans through the means of natural language.\n"

But one thing to consider here is that, this indeed is a very ***primitive*** sentiment analysis. We used two *pre-trained* models-NLTK's Vader Sentiment Analyzer and TextBlob--to give us a sentiment score, which we then averaged to give us our final score. Both of these pre-trained models use a Bag-Of-Words approach in which each word in a sentence has a sentiment-score, and the final sentence/text sentiment score is a function of these individuals scores. These models try, but are not great at understanding context. With these, among other, considerations in mind--it would be inappropriate to use these tools to make any final judgements.\n",
